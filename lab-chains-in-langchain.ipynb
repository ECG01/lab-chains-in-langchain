This phenomenon is described by Planck's law, which states that the intensity of radiation emitted by a black body is a function of its temperature and the wavelength of the radiation.

      "Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is directly related to the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This means that measuring the state of one particle instantly determines the state of the other, even if they are light-years apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "The exact mechanism behind quantum entanglement is still not fully understood, but it is believed to involve a non-local connection between the particles that allows them to share information instantaneously. This phenomenon is a key aspect of quantum mechanics and has been experimentally verified through various tests and experiments.\n",

      "In calculus, a derivative is a measure of how a function changes as its input changes. It represents the rate of change of a function at a specific point. \n",
      "\n",
      "To find the derivative of a function, we use the concept of limits. We calculate the slope of the tangent line to the function at a specific point, which gives us the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that point. \n",
      "\n",
      "The derivative of a function can also be interpreted as the function's rate of change over time. For example, if we have a function that represents the position of an object over time, its derivative would give us the object's velocity at any given moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Derivatives are fundamental in calculus as they allow us to analyze the behavior of functions, find maximum and minimum points, and solve optimization problems. They are also used in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and biology to model and understand real-world phenomena.\n",
